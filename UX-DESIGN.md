# User Experience Design

The following document presents the UX design for **Smart Fit**, a mobile-first fitness companion app that helps users manage workouts, find partners, and optimize gym sessions.  
These wireframes and the app map illustrate the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) flow and main user interactions, designed collaboratively in Figma.

## App Map

The App Map below shows the primary navigation flow of **Smart Fit**.  
Users begin by either registering a new account or logging in to an existing one, both of which lead to the Dashboard/Home Page. From there, users can explore several core features:

* **History** – Review previous workouts, including sets, reps, duration, and calories burned.
* **Queues** – Join or monitor a queue for specific gym equipment.
* **Profile** – View personal fitness data and edit key metrics.
* **Settings** – Update preferences, account details, and app configurations.
