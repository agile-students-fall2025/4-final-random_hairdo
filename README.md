# SmartFit

**Smart Campus Fitness Coordination Platform**

## What is SmartFit?

Campus fitness centers face a consistent problem: unpredictable crowding creates friction in students' workout routines. Beyond just knowing how busy a gym is, students struggle to coordinate with workout partners, find accountability, and optimize their limited time between classes. **SmartFit** solves this by combining live facility insights with social coordination features, turning the gym experience from chaotic to collaborative.

### Why SmartFit?

NYU students dedicate a lot fo time to academics or the city lifestyle. With a school as large as NYU, their athletic facilities/gyms comes with a lot of management problems for students. Crowds, equipment avaliability and optimizing your allocated time, and hours.  SmartFit transforms the campus fitness experience by providing real-time insights, smart coordination tools, and a centralized platform for a better athletic experience on campus.

## Project History

The management of NYU's athletic facilities is a shared frustration among five NYU students during the fall 2024 semester. It is a campus-wide issue affecting thousands of students trying to balance fitness with demanding academic schedules, important for mental and physical health. We wanted to build a tool that makes campus fitness accessible, efficient, and social**. We saw an opportunity to apply our software engineering skills to solve a real problem affecting our daily lives and the broader NYU community.

Drawing inspiration from modern service coordination platforms while adding our own innovative spin on social fitness features, we set out to create something that goes beyond simple occupancy tracking. SmartFit represents our vision of what campus recreation can be: connected, predictive, and built by students, for students.
